description: Rules for building and editing Chan Riiny's artist portfolio site
scope: workspace
rules:
  - Never invent artwork titles, descriptions, categories, exhibitions, prices, or client lists.
  - Only use content from Chan Riiny’s provided artist statement and senior thesis for biography and narrative sections.
  - Always refer to Chan Riiny as a mural and shoe design artist.
  - All placeholder text, images, or metadata must be clearly marked with “[placeholder]”.
  - Visual style: black background, white serif typography, high contrast, generous whitespace, minimal hover effects, and clean image-led layouts.
  - Navigation must remain left-aligned site name and right-aligned links: Work, Artist Statement, Thesis, Contact, Instagram.
  - Homepage must remain a gallery-first page with a responsive grid/masonry of artworks.
  - Do not add e-commerce, pricing, or shop features unless explicitly requested.
  - Maintain accessibility: ARIA-compliant lightbox, alt text for all images, keyboard navigation, and WCAG AA contrast.
  - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes only; no external CSS frameworks.
  - All code must be clean, commented, and production-ready with room for content expansion.
